# Test Notification Fix - Version 0.1.9

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Notification Debugging
- Added detailed console logs to track notification flow
- Added logs in `showEpubNotification()` to confirm when it's called
- Added error handling for notification creation

### 2. Aggressive Log Reduction
- Added `lastCheckTime` tracking to limit checks to once every 2 seconds
- Increased debounce timeouts:
  - Visible editors: 500ms → 1500ms
  - Active editor: 400ms → 1200ms  
  - Tab changes: 600ms → 2000ms

### 3. Improved State Management
- Enhanced console logs to show state changes
- Better tracking of notification state

## Testing Steps

1. **Open EPUB file**: `code "El final del bosque - Maria Fasce.epub"`
2. **Check console logs** in VS Code Developer Console:
   - Should see: `[EPUB] New EPUB file detected: /path/to/file.epub`
   - Should see: `[EPUB] Showing notification for: /path/to/file.epub`
   - Should see: `[EPUB] showEpubNotification called for: /path/to/file.epub`
   - Should see: `[EPUB] Creating notification for file: filename.epub`
   - Should see: `[EPUB] Notification created successfully`

3. **Look for notification popup** in VS Code
4. **Test notification response**:
   - Click "Abrir como Carpeta Virtual" → should open EPUB as virtual folder
   - Click "No mostrar más para este archivo" → should add to notified files
   - Dismiss without clicking → should allow notification to appear again

## Expected Results

✅ **Fixed Issues:**
- Notification should now appear when EPUB files are detected
- Console logs should be significantly reduced
- Only meaningful state changes should be logged
- Notification system should work reliably

✅ **Preserved Features:**
- Status bar item still appears for EPUB files
- Context menu items still work
- Command palette commands still work
- All existing functionality maintained

## Key Code Changes

### checkCurrentFileForEpub()
```typescript
// Prevent excessive checks - limit to once every 2 seconds
const now = Date.now();
if (now - lastCheckTime < 2000) {
    return false;
}
lastCheckTime = now;
```

### showEpubNotification()
```typescript
console.log(`[EPUB] showEpubNotification called for: ${filePath}`);
// ... detailed logging throughout the function
try {
    currentNotification = vscode.window.showInformationMessage(...)
    console.log(`[EPUB] Notification created successfully`);
} catch (error) {
    console.error(`[EPUB] Error creating notification:`, error);
}
```

## Version History
